# Utopian Labs - Open-Source System Prompts

Welcome to [Utopian Labs](https://www.utopianlabs.ai/)! We're an AI lab obsessed with making sales teams unstoppable. We build next-gen AI to help you crush your sales goals.

## Trust and Transparency in AI

Here at Utopian Labs, transparency and teamwork are in our DNA. That's why we're throwing open the doors on the system prompts we use to power and test our AI models. Our goal is simple:

- **Enable Fair Comparisons:** Let anyone pit their models against ours, fair and square, using the same playbook.
- **Foster Trust:** Show you exactly how our AI thinks and how we measure its chops.
- **Encourage Innovation:** Spark new ideas and get the community to help us make these prompts even better.

## Our First Release: Cold Email Model - `cold-email-1`

Kicking things off, we're dropping the system prompt for our brand-new cold email whiz, `cold-email-1`.

- **Prompt Location:** [`cold-email-1/system.j2`](./cold-email-1/system.j2)

This is the secret sauce that helps `cold-email-1` write killer, personalized cold emails. Use it to see what makes our model tick and to run your own tests, just like we do.

## How to Use These Prompts

Grab these prompts and plug them into any compatible language model to:

1.  **Understand Model Behavior:** See how different AIs react to the same marching orders.
2.  **Evaluate Performance:** Run your own bake-offs and see who comes out on top.
3.  **Develop New Prompts:** Use our prompts as a launchpad for your own awesome creations.
